# tuby-sniff
An anesthesia mask adapted to mice for stereotaxic devices.

Ready-to-print CTB files are here + instructions to build the system (How to build your amazing Tuby-Sniff).

Designed for the 3D printer ELEGOO MARS 2 PRO and for a biocompatible resin as the ANYCUBIC ECO Plant-base 405nm UV RESIN BLACK (color adapted to see better the slices).

The different steps to build the tuby-sniff:

1-Print the different parts of the tuby-sniff. If you try to make a new .ctb file using chitubox, make sure to give an angle of 9° (head down) and a z-lift height of 2mm for the tuby-sniff_head and tuby-sniff_arm. Otherwise the prints will be quite odd. For the tuby-sniff_pivot, it should be print vertically. 

2-Wash the different parts. Since there is small holes in the head and arm, everything should be washed carefully. Then rub a bit of alcohol on the different pieces to remove all the resine and make sure to remove everything in the holes with a needle. Then make them dry.

3-Cure the parts during 3 minutes. If the pieces are not washed enough they will be sticky. You could try to rub a bit of alcohol to remove that. If the pieces were not dried enough, there will be some white spots here and there.

4-Assemble the tuby-sniff. Quite easy, put the arm and the head together and then insert the pivot. Then, put super-glue on the outside of the arm and pivot. But not on the head and on the holes.

5-Add the tubing to the tuby-snif. Cut two 10cm-long plastic tubes of 1mm of diameter, insert then in the two holes of the head. Try to get only 3mm of tubes inside the head, then use super glue to fix the tubes on the head. 

6-Add adaptators. Insert a 10uL pipette tip at each tube's end. Then use super glue to fix the junction.

7-Craft a stop rod. For that use a 23Gx1" (0.6x25) needle, cut the sharp end.

Now you can orient the tuby-sniff head as you want and fix it by inserting the stop rod in the holes present on the tuby-sniff arm.
